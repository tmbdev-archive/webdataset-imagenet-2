The command line program is identical to the command line program using ssh-based training, but the environment variables are set for you automatically."

    "## Distributed Training Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental problem with multinode distributed training is that it is difficult for multiple nodes to have exactly the same number of training batches, since the number of shards may not be evenly divisible by the number of nodes and workers, and since shards may not all contain the same number of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common ways of dealing with this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. resampling: each worker picks one of the shards at random and returns samples from this; this leads to some samples being duplicated during each epoch, but is still statistically sound. This is the default. It works well for large datasets and large numbers of shards.\n",
    "2. exact epochs with `Join`: the shards are split between all the compute nodes and workers and each worker iterates through its data until it runs out; at the end of training, batches become smaller as some of the GPUs have run out of training data. This ensures that each training sample is presented exactly once during each epoch. It differs from \"traditional\" single GPU training in that batch size is slightly variable. This mode can be enabled with the `--splitshards` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see the code for how these different modes are enabled. The command line interface and data loaders are defined in `imagenet.py`, and the training loop itself is in `utils.py`."
